# entangled-watermark-torch

This repository is an unofficial pytorch-based implementation of the paper [Entangled Watermarks as a Defense against Model Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12200).

We test our code on five datasets: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

### Dependency

Our code is implemented and tested on Pytorch. Just use the following command to install the dependencies. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Preprocessing and Training

Basically the process and command to train is the same as the original one. For details, Please refer to [Official repo](https://github.com/cleverhans-lab/entangled-watermark).
